with 4 sigma and 5 kernel size i got matrix of gaussian blur, then i convolved it with 0.5 matrix 3x3 matrix and i got matrix 
0.035228	0.038671	0.039892	0.038671	0.035228
0.038671	0.042452	0.043792	0.042452	0.038671
0.039892	0.043792	0.045175	0.043792	0.039892
0.038671	0.042452	0.043792	0.042452	0.038671

which is more or less optimal filter which we can use to obtain smooth regions for all layers.
