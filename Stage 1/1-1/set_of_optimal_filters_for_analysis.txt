In general there is some set of filters which provided satisfying result for analysis.

1. Gaussian Blur with kernel 3-5 depending on the picture.(We should always apply this 
filter before extraction of binary layers. 
2. Binary layer. 
3. Then too smoothen the result we should apply median filter with kernel
 3-5 depending on the noise. 
4. In case of dissolving boundries we can apply max filter, else if there is 
some noise remaining min filter is good.
